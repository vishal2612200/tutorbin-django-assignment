## How to create custom tags for image

You can create tags through django admin 

## Features implemented

- [x] Each image can have tags(can be multiple tags)
- [x] Paginate the pages (max 8 images per page)
- [x] We can filter the images in the gallery by their tags (single or multiple). Selecting a tag or some tags will show only the images with those tags in the gallery.
- [x] Clicking an image in gallery will take us to a page for that specific image. Add two buttons there to rotate the image 90 degree clockwise or anti-clockwise
- [x] Add an input form to upload new images
